# Guardian Staking Process

## Staking through Web Wallet

Access the [Theta Web Wallet](https://wallet.thetatoken.org/) from your desktop/laptop. Under the “Theta Wallet” logo, you can click the drop down menu to select a network. Change the selected network to “Testnet_Amber: THETA testnet for Guardian Nodes”

Unlock your Theta wallet using your typical access method (keystore, seed phrase, hardware wallet, etc.). Once your wallet is unlocked, click the “Stakes” tab of the menu and click “Deposit Stake”.

In the Guardian Node Holder (Summary) field, enter the text string from your Guardian Node app. Enter the Amount of THETA you want to stake to this node and click “Deposit Stake". After reviewing your stake deposit info, enter your wallet password, then click "Confirm & Deposit Stake".  

After the stake deposit transaction is confirmed, you can switch back to the Guardian node to [verify that it is working as expected](docs/GUI.md#verify-the-guardian-node)
